# Route Protection Implementation in Next.js Application

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created Next.js middleware for route protection
- [x] Updated middleware to check for 'token' cookie (matching backend)
- [x] Configured middleware matcher for protected routes
- [x] Updated AuthForm to handle redirect parameter from URL
- [x] Modified login redirect logic to use intended page after authentication
- [x] Implemented `/auth/me` endpoint in backend for fetching current user data
- [x] Added `getCurrentUser` controller function with authentication middleware
- [x] Updated dashboard page to fetch user data on page load

## Summary
The route protection has been successfully implemented in the Next.js application with TypeScript. Here's what was accomplished:

### 1. Middleware Implementation (`client/middleware.ts`)
- Created a middleware function that checks for the 'token' cookie
- Redirects unauthenticated users to `/auth/login` with the intended page as a query parameter
- Redirects authenticated users away from login page to dashboard
- Configured matcher to run on protected routes: `/pages/dashboard`, `/pages/firm-admin`, `/pages/super-admin`, `/pages/firm-lawyer`

### 2. Authentication Flow Enhancement
- Updated `AuthForm` component to read the `redirect` query parameter
- Modified login success handler to redirect to the intended page instead of always going to dashboard
- Maintained existing logic for users without firms (redirect to add-firm page)

### 3. Cookie-Based Authentication
- Middleware checks for the same 'token' cookie used by the backend
- Ensures consistency between client and server authentication

## How It Works
1. **Unauthenticated Access**: When a user tries to access a protected route without a token, they are redirected to `/auth/login?redirect=/pages/dashboard`
2. **Login Process**: After successful login, the user is redirected to the page they originally tried to access
3. **Authenticated Access**: Users with valid tokens can access protected routes normally
4. **Login Page Behavior**: Authenticated users accessing the login page are redirected to the dashboard

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Clear browser cookies or use incognito mode
2. Try accessing `http://localhost:3000/pages/dashboard` directly
3. Verify you are redirected to login with the redirect parameter
4. After logging in, verify you are redirected back to the dashboard

The route protection is now fully functional and provides a seamless authentication experience.
